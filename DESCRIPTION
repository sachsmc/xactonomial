Description: We consider the k sample multinomial problem where we observe k vectors
    (possibly of different lengths), each representing an independent sample from
    a multinomial. For a given function psi which takes in the concatenated
    vector of multinomial probabilities and outputs a real number, we are
    interested in constructing a confidence interval for psi. We use an exact (but 
    computational and stochastic) method to compute a confidence interval and a 
    function for calculation of p values. The details of the method will be in a 
    forthcoming preprint.
